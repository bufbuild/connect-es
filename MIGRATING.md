# Connect v1 to v2 migration guide

Connect v2 provides new features and simplifies some common APIs. In addition,
it makes use of all the enhancements of Protobuf-ES v2. If you're currently 
using Connect v1, this document walks you through all you need to know to migrate
and start using it right away.

## Running the migration tool

To help with the process of migrating, we provide a tool called 
[@connectrpc/connect-migrate](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect-migrate) 
which will take care of dependency and plugin updates as well as a few minor code
changes. So, as a first step, you will need to run the migration tool. To do so, 
execute the following command:

`npx @connectrpc/connect-migrate@v2.0.0`

While the tool will do a lot of the dependency legwork for you, there are many
use cases in code that it does not cover. Below, we list everything that has changed in 
v2. Changes that are handled by the migration tool are noted as such.

In summary, the suggested way to migrate to Connect v2 is to first run the migration tool
and then go through the list below, fixing any other instances that weren't handled.

## What's changed

### Dependency updates

Perhaps the biggest thing to be aware of is that the plugin `protoc-gen-connect-es` has been
removed in v2. Connect now relies on service descriptors generated by the Protobuf-ES v2
`protoc-gen-es` and no longer generates code itself.

So the first major part of the migration path is removing any usage of the old 
`protoc-gen-connect-es` plugin. This could include:

- Removing `protoc-gen-connect-es` from `package.json`.
- Removing any usage of the plugin in `buf.gen.yaml`.
- Removing any dependency on Generated SDKs for Connect from `package.json`.

The next step is to upgrade any dependencies on [Protobuf-ES packages](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es?tab=readme-ov-file#packages)  
to use v2.

The final step is to update the Connect [packages](#packages) in your project 
to use v2.

:white_check_mark: The `connect-migrate` tool will handle all of these changes.

### Generated code

The next step is to re-generate code. The migration tool does not handle code
generation, so be sure to do so in whatever way your project is configured. For
example, `npx buf generate`, etc.

There are a few things to be aware with the switch to the Protobuf-ES v2 plugin
as some of the options for that plugin have changed with its v2 release:

* The `import_extension` option is now set to `none` by default, which means it doesn't 
  add a `.js` extension to import paths. If you use the plugin option 
  `import_extension=none`, you can delete it. If you require imports to have the 
  `.js` extension, use `import_extension=js`.
* The `ts_nocheck` option  is now off by default. If you require a `// @ts-nocheck` 
  annotation at the top of generated code, use the option `ts_nocheck=true`.

For more information, see the [Protobuf-ES v2 migration guide](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/MANUAL.md#migrating-from-version-1).

When generating code, you should make sure to delete any now-unused `*_connect.ts` 
files. An easy way to do this is to use the `clean` option provided by the Buf CLI,
introduced in v1.36.0. See the docs [here](https://buf.build/docs/configuration/v2/buf-gen-yaml/?h=clean) 
for specifying `clean` in your config files. Note that you can also specify `--clean`
to any `buf generate` CLI commands you are running.

### Import paths

Once your code is generated and the vestigial `*_connect` files are removed, 
import paths should be updated. This is usually an update from `*_connect` to
`*_pb`:

```diff
- import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_connect.js";
+ import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_pb.js"; 
```

:white_check_mark: The `connect-migrate` tool will handle this.

### Working with generated code

As mentioned, Connect now solely uses the `protoc-gen-es` plugin provided by  
Protobuf-ES v2. As a result, working with generated code has changed in some
areas.

#### Creating messages 

To create a new instance, you now call the function `create()` provided by
Protobuf-ES and pass the generated schema:

```diff
- import { SayRequest } from "./gen/eliza_connect.js";
- import { SayRequestSchema } from "./gen/eliza_pb.js";
+ import { create } from "@bufbuild/protobuf";

- const sayRequest = new SayRequest({
+ const sayRequest = create(UserSchema, {
  sentence: "Hello",
});
```

#### Service descriptors

Connect now relies on service descriptors generated by the Protobuf-ES v2
`protoc-gen-es` plugin. The v2 service descriptors aren't much different from 
the service descriptors previously generated by Connect v1. The same basic 
information i.e. (typed metadata) is still generated, but it's generated by 
`protoc-gen-es` now, along with additional information available. For example, 
v2 now provides the full descriptor, with features such as [custom options](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/v2.2.2/MANUAL.md#custom-options), 
which can be very useful in interceptors.

One breaking change to be aware with service descriptors is that the access 
pattern of the `MethodDescriptor` has slightly changed. 

Service descriptors in Connect v1 looked like this:

```ts
// protoc-gen-connect-es v1
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_connect";
ElizaService.typeName; // "connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService"
ElizaService.methods.say;
ElizaService.methods.say.name; // "Say"
ElizaService.methods.say.kind; // MethodKind.Unary
ElizaService.methods.say.idempotency; // MethodIdempotency.NoSideEffects
```

Compare this to what is now generated by `protoc-gen-es` v2:

```ts
// protoc-gen-es v2
import { ElizaService } from "./gen/eliza_pb";
ElizaService.typeName; // "connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService"
ElizaService.method.say;
ElizaService.method.say.name; // "Say"
ElizaService.method.say.methodKind; // "unary"
ElizaService.method.say.idempotency; //  MethodOptions_IdempotencyLevel.NoSideEffects
```

Notice that instead of the plural form `methods`, it now uses the singular 
`method`.

Other than the above, the generated properties remain largely unchanged and 
request and responses do not need any updates when initializers are used or 
dot notation is used. However, a few noteworthy changes to be aware of:

* The `toPlainMessage` function and the `PlainMessage<T>` type are no longer 
  necessary. If you create a proto3 message with `create(UserSchema)`, the 
  returned object is already a plain object. You can replace the 
  `PlainMessage<User>` types with `User`. The only difference is that `User` has 
  a property `$typeName`, which is a simple string with the full name of
  the message like `"example.User"`. This property makes sure you don't pass the 
  wrong message to a function by accident.
* The `PartialMessage` type has been mostly replaced by `MessageInitShape`, which 
  extracts the init type from a message descriptor.
* A message field using [`google.protobuf.Struct`](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/MANUAL.md#googleprotobufstruct) 
  is now generated as more-convenient `JsonObject`.
* `proto2` fields with default values are no longer generated as optional 
  properties.
* All well-known types and helpers have been moved to an export under 
  `@bufbuild/protobuf/wkt`. For example, when converting a `google.protobuf.Timestamp` 
  to an ECMAScript Date object, it is no longer possible via a method. 

For more information on all Protobuf-ES v2 changes, see the Protobuf-ES [manual](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/MANUAL.md)
as well as the [Protobuf-ES v2 migration guide](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es/blob/main/MANUAL.md#update-your-code).

### Other breaking changes

* Promise clients are now the default and the previously-deprecated
  `createPromiseClient` has been removed. Any callsites using `createPromiseClient`
  should be updated to use `createClient`.

  :white_check_mark: The `connect-migrate` tool will handle this.

* The gRPC Transport now requires HTTP/2. If you are using `createGrpcTransport`
  and specifying an `httpVersion`, it will fail compilation. Remove the
  `httpVersion` property to use the default of HTTP/2.

  Note that if you were relying on HTTP/1.1 as part of your gRPC strategy, this
  may require bigger architectural changes, but the hope is that this is not a
  common problem.

* Previously, Connect allowed request objects with matching shapes to be passed
  to API calls interchangeably as long as the passed object was a superset of the
  target type. For example, given the following proto definitions:

  ```protobuf
  syntax = "proto3";
  package example.v1;
  message MessageA {
    string field_a = 1;
  }
  message MessageB {
    string field_a = 1;
    int64 field_b = 2;
  }
  service ExampleService {
    rpc RequestA(MessageA) returns (Empty) {}
    rpc RequestB(MessageB) returns (Empty) {}
  }
  ```

  The following would have passed TypeScript compilation:

  ```ts
  client.requestA(new MessageA());
  client.requestA(new MessageB());
  ```

  This was an unintended bug and not a feature. In Connect v2, only the specified
  target type will pass compilation.

- We have removed the `credentials` option from transports as well as the `init`
  option in interceptors. These two options were used to customize `fetch` routines.
  Users should now rely on the `fetch` option in transports as a way to perform
  these customizations. For example:

  ```ts
  createConnectTransport({
    baseUrl: "/",
    fetch: (input, init) => fetch(input, { ...init, credentials: "include" }),
  });
  ```

  In addition, as a replacement to determine whether an incoming request is a
  Connect GET request in server-side interceptors, the property `requestMethod: string`
  has been added to intercepted requests. This property is symmetrical to `HandlerContext.requestMethod`.

* Errors details are now a pair of desc and init values. In Connect v1, error
  details were specified as message instances. In v2, error
  details are now an object that specifies both a schema and initialization
  object which are both passed to the `create` function of Protobuf-ES. For example:

  ```diff
  - import { LocalizedMessage } from "./gen/google/rpc/error_details_pb";
  - const details = [
  -   new LocalizedMessage({
  -       locale: "fr-CH",
  -       message: "Je n'ai plus de mots.",
  -   }),
  - ];
  + import { LocalizedMessageSchema } from "./gen/google/rpc/error_details_pb";
  + const details = [
  +   {
  +     desc: LocalizedMessageSchema,
  +     value: {
  +       locale: "fr-CH",
  +       message: "Je n'ai plus de mots.",
  +     }
  +   },
  + ];

  const metadata = new Headers({
    "words-left": "none"
  });
  throw new ConnectError(
    "I have no words anymore.",
    Code.ResourceExhausted,
    metadata,
    details
  );
  ```

* `MethodDescriptor` is now self-sufficient. In v1, method descriptors always
  had to be used alongside the service descriptors. In v2, they can now be used
  standalone. This means that all callsites that previously passed a service
  and method descriptor should now just pass the method descriptor.

  A notable example is when using a Connect `Router` on the server-side:

  ```diff
  const routes = ({rpc}: Router) => {
  -   rpc(ElizaService, ElizaService.say, impl);
  +   rpc(ElizaService.say, impl);
  }
  ```

* Interceptors for streaming RPCs now use appropriate stream types. In
  v1, the server used more exact types in interceptors, for example `UnaryRequest`
  for server-streaming rpcs while the client always used streaming variants.
  This was unintended behavior and has been fixed in v2. Now all streaming RPCs
  use the `StreamRequest` and `StreamResponse` types on the server as well.

* Node 16 is no longer supported. Connect v2 now supports Node versions 18.14.1 and up.

* Connect v2 now requires at least TypeScript v4.9.5.
