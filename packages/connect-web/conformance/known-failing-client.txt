# These tests are failing as follows:
# - in all browsers/environments with the callback client, cancellations are calling the end-of-stream callback with an undefined error if a call is cancelled.
# - in firefox with the promise client, the error is actual error {code: 2 (unknown), message: "AbortError: The operation was aborted. "} does not match expected code 1 (canceled)
