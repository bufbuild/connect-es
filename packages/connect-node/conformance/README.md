# Connect-Node Conformance Tests

This directory provides conformance test coverage for @connectrpc/connect-node for both clients and servers. 

It uses the [conformance runner](https://github.com/connectrpc/conformance/releases) to run the tests.

## Running conformance tests

`npm run conformance` - runs all conformance tests for client and server.

`npm run conformance:client` - runs only client conformance tests.

`npm run conformance:server` - runs only server conformance tests.
