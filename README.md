# Connect for ECMAScript

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/connectrpc/connect-es?color=blue)](./LICENSE) [![Build](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/actions/workflows/ci.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-es/actions/workflows/ci.yaml) [![NPM Version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@connectrpc/connect/latest?color=green&label=%40connectrpc%2Fconnect)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect)

Connect is a family of libraries for building type-safe APIs with different languages and platforms.
[@connectrpc/connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@connectrpc/connect) brings them to TypeScript,
the web browser, and to Node.js.

With Connect, you define your schema first:

```
service ElizaService {
  rpc Say(SayRequest) returns (SayResponse) {}
}
```

And with the magic of code generation, this schema produces servers and clients:

```ts
const answer = await eliza.say({ sentence: "I feel happy." });
console.log(answer);
// {sentence: 'When you feel happy, what do you do?'}
```

Unlike REST, the Remote Procedure Call are type-safe, but they are regular HTTP
under the hood. You can see all requests in the network inspector, and you
can `curl` them if you want:

```shell
curl \
    --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    --data '{"sentence": "I feel happy."}' \
    https://demo.connectrpc.com/connectrpc.eliza.v1.ElizaService/Say
```

Connect uses [Protobuf-ES](https://github.com/bufbuild/protobuf-es), the only
[fully-compliant](https://buf.build/blog/protobuf-conformance) Protobuf JavaScript library.

Connect implements RPC three protocols: The widely available gRPC and
gRPC-web protocols, and Connect's [own protocol](https://connectrpc.com/docs/protocol/),
optimized for the web. This gives you unparalleled interoperability across many
platforms and languages, with type-safety end-to-end.

## Get started on the web

Follow our [10 minute tutorial](https://connectrpc.com/docs/web/getting-started) where
we use [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and [React](https://reactjs.org/) to create a
web interface for ELIZA.

**React**, **Svelte**, **Vue**, **Next.js** and **Angular** are supported (see [examples](https://github.com/connectrpc/examples-es)),
and we have an expansion pack for [TanStack Query](https://github.com/connectrpc/connect-query-es).
We support all modern web browsers that implement the widely available
[fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API)
and the [Encoding API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Encoding_API).

## Get started on Node.js

Follow our [10 minute tutorial](https://connectrpc.com/docs/node/getting-started)
to spin up a service in Node.js, and call it from the web, and from a gRPC client
in your terminal.

You can serve your Connect RPCs with vanilla Node.js, or use our [server plugins](https://connectrpc.com/docs/node/server-plugins)
for **Fastify**, **Next.js**, and **Express**. We support Node.js v18.14.1 and later with
the builtin `http` and `http2` modules.

## Migrating from version 1

Version 2 provides many new features and simplifies some common APIs. In addition, 
it makes use of all the enhancements of Protobuf-ES v2. To upgrade, you'll need 
to update your dependencies, re-generate code, and update call sites in your application.

The first thing to be aware of is that the plugin `protoc-gen-connect-es` has been
removed in v2. Connect now relies on descriptors generated by Protobuf-ES v2. 
When upgrading, you will first need to remove any usage of this plugin. For most
users, this means a combination of any of the following steps:

* Remove `protoc-gen-connect-es` from their `package.json` either manually or
  via a package manager, i.e. `npm uninstall @connectrpc/protoc-gen-connect-es`.

* Remove any usage of the plugin in `buf.gen.yaml`.

* Remove any dependency on Generated SDKs for Connect from `package.json` using
  the same approach used for removing the plugin. Users should then rely on 
  types from the `@bufbuild_es` plugin instead. This will also necessitate a code 
  change, which is usually a simple import path update from *_connect to *_pb.

Next, as mentioned, Connect uses Protobuf-ES v2, so you will need to upgrade any
dependencies you have on its relevant packages:

```shellsession
npm install @bufbuild/protobuf@^2.0.0 @bufbuild/protoc-gen-es@^2.0.0
```

Finally, update the [packages](#packages) you use with your package manager of choice.
For example, with NPM:

```shellsession
npm install @connectrpc/connect@^2.0.0 @connectrpc/connect-web@^2.0.0
```

### Update your code

Next, you'll need to account for any breaking changes. Following is a list to
be aware of:

* The gRPC Transport now requires HTTP/2. If you are using `createGrpcTransport` 
  and specifying an `httpVersion`, it will fail compilation. Remove the 
  `httpVersion` property to use the default. 

  Note that if you were relying on HTTP/1.1 as part of your gRPC strategy, this
  may require bigger architectural changes, but the hope is that this is not a
  common problem.

* Promise clients are now the default and the previously-deprecated 
  `createPromiseClient` has been removed. Any callsites using `createPromiseClient`
  should be updated to use `createClient`.

* Node 16 is no longer supported. Connect v2 now supports Node versions 18.14.1 and up.

* Previously, Connect allowed request objects with matching shapes to be passed
  to API calls interchangeably as long as the passed object was a superset of the
  target type. For example, given the following proto definitions:

  ```protobuf
  syntax = "proto3";
  package example.v1;
  message MessageA {
    string field_a = 1;
  }
  message MessageB {
    string field_a = 1;
    int64 field_b = 2;
  }
  service ExampleService {
    rpc RequestA(MessageA) returns (Empty) {}
    rpc RequestB(MessageB) returns (Empty) {}
  }
  ```

  The following would have passed TypeScript compilation:

  ```ts
  client.requestA(new MessageA())
  client.requestA(new MessageB())
  ```

  This was an unintended bug and not a feature and in Connect v2, only the specified
  target type will pass compilation.

* We have removed the `credentials` option from transports as well as the `init`
  option in interceptors. These two options were used to customize `fetch` routines.
  Users should now rely on the `fetch` option in transports as a way to perform
  these customizations. For example:

  ```ts
  createConnectTransport({
    baseUrl: "/",
    fetch: (input, init) => fetch(input, {...init, credentials: "include"}),
  });
  ```

  In addition, as a replacement to determine whether an incoming request is a 
  Connect GET request in server-side interceptors, the property `requestMethod: string`
  has been added to intercepted requests. This property is symmetrical to `HandlerContext.requestMethod`.

* The access pattern of `MethodDescriptor` has slightly changed. In v2, the 
  Protobuf-ES plugin generates service descriptors and changes the 
  access pattern for method descriptors. Instead of the plural form `methods`,
  it now uses the singular `method`.

  For example: `ElizaService.methods.Say` now becomes `ElizaService.method.Say`.

* Errors details are now a pair of desc and init values. In Connect v1, error 
  details were specified as message instances. In v2, error 
  details are now an object that specifies both a schema and initialization
  object which are both passed to the `create` function of Protobuf-ES. For example:

  ```diff
  - import { LocalizedMessage } from "./gen/google/rpc/error_details_pb";
  - const details = [
  -   new LocalizedMessage({
  -       locale: "fr-CH",
  -       message: "Je n'ai plus de mots.",
  -   }),
  - ];
  + import { LocalizedMessageSchema } from "./gen/google/rpc/error_details_pb";
  + const details = [
  +   {
  +     desc: LocalizedMessageSchema,
  +     value: {
  +       locale: "fr-CH",
  +       message: "Je n'ai plus de mots.",
  +     }
  +   },
  + ];
  const metadata = new Headers({
    "words-left": "none"
  }); 
  throw new ConnectError(
    "I have no words anymore.",
    Code.ResourceExhausted,
    metadata,
    details
  );
  ```

* `MethodDescriptor` is now self-sufficient. In v1, method descriptors always 
  had to be used alongside the service descriptors. In v2, they can now be used
  standalone. This means that all callsites that previously passed a service 
  and method descriptor can now just pass the method descriptor. 

  A notable example is when using a Connect `Router` on the server-side:

  ```diff
  const routes = ({rpc}: Router) => {
  -   rpc(ElizaService, ElizaService.say, impl);
  +   rpc(ElizaService.say, impl);
  }
  ```

* Interceptors for streaming RPCs now use appropriate stream types. In 
  v1, the server used more exact types in interceptors, for example `UnaryRequest`
  for server-streaming rpcs while the client always used streaming variants. 
  This was unintended behavior and has been fixed in v2. Now all streaming RPCs
  use the `StreamRequest` and `StreamResponse` on the server as well.
